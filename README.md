- 👋 Hi, I’m @vigne-Sh [ Vignesh S ]
- 👀 I’m interested in scaling robust full stack apps
     and hands on experience in aws services that reduces
     manual effort & learning new technologies that makes
     a differnce in people's lives
- 🐼 I Love to invent & simplify by dive deep into
     problems and solve them with quality delivery of results
- 💻 I Joined as Fresher in Amazon as manual tester and
     got promoted in short span of time as 
     Quality Assurance Technician ( QAT -1 ) because of
     my contributions to device testing automation and
     scaled many python scripting to building scalable
     many full stack apps in flask & django with pandas as
     core library automating project tools like `testrail`, 
     `jira` , `kota`, `kbits` & worked on `pytest` framework
     and also build big data handling and tuning data
     with matplot lib overall the tools I developed has
     saved / reduced 2 to 4 full time employees effort
     to my team for the financial year
- 🐬 I have built a chat bot using aws ( amazon web services )
     that addressed floor & technical support to entire org
     members and reduces constant manual dependencies in
     floor support and also contributed to apps / projects that
     are built through `aws ( amazon web services)`
     and I have worked in creating version_set, building
     pipeline and maintaining approval workflows and also
     in converitng repeated manual effort into automation effort 
- 🐧 I priotise the effort put in creating a tool or scaling
     a app is as equal as documenting the code / project work with
     `documentation & updating doc_strings` and also logging
     the steps to pre-requisite test and tear down the
     code, I love documenting which helps others 
     consume what we build easily and keeps it running
     on a long term
- 🦄 I've mentored many associates in my team and made
    quality code getting contributed for my team's framework
    through quality code reviews and assistance showing a
    form of ownership & leadership
- 🧗 I'm also lead engineer for scaling automation in
    my team to increase the automation percentage from
    20 % to 50 % by automating manual scenarios of 
    device testing with our automation framework 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, js and mern stack to advance level
     to fit into a profile for full stack developer
- 🦖 I love trading as a passive income with high brain game
     and am a full time investor trying to scale in long term
     greenish portfolio and I'm also working on stock analysis
     app for investing which will help my personal needs
     and utilizing automation help in real life
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on organizaiton that values my contribution
